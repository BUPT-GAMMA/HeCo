## Environment Settings
> python==3.8.5 \
> scipy==1.5.4 \
> torch==1.7.0 \
> numpy==1.19.2 \
> scikit_learn==0.24.2

GPU: GeForce RTX 2080 Ti \

## Usage
Fisrt, go into ./code, and then you can use the following commend to run our model: 
> python main.py acm/dblp/aminer/freebase --gpu=0
## Some tips in parameters
1. We suggest you to carefully select the *“pos_num”* (existed in ./data/pos.py) to ensure the threshold of postives for every node. This is very important to final results. Of course, more effective way to select positives is welcome.
2. In ./code/utils/params.py, except "lr" and "patience", meticulously tuning dropout and tau is applaudable.
